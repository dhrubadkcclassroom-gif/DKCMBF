The Dhakuakhana College Mutual Benefit Fund (MBF) is a collective financial support system formed by the employees and staff of the college. It functions with the primary objective of extending financial assistance to its members through loans at a minimal interest rate. The MBF operates on the principle of mutual cooperation, where the contributions made by members create a common pool of resources to meet financial needs. One of its notable features is the provision of emergency loans, where members can avail up to â‚¹40,000 at a time, ensuring quick relief in times of urgency. The interest rate on loans is subject to change from time to time depending on prevailing financial conditions and policy decisions of the fund committee. By offering accessible and low-interest loans, the MBF not only helps in reducing financial burdens of stakeholders but also strengthens the sense of solidarity and security among college employees.
